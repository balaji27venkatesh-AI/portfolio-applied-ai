# Applied AI Portfolio

This repository contains my hands-on work as I transition from 
Business Intelligence to Applied AI / ML Engineering.

## Structure
- micro-projects: small focused experiments (Python, Pandas, SQL → AI)
- macro-projects: end-to-end applied AI systems
- big-experiments: LLMs, RAG, Agent experiments
- utils: shared helpers

## Focus Areas
- Python & Data Foundations
- Applied Machine Learning
- LLMs, RAG, and AI Agents
- Evaluation & reliability

This repo is actively evolving through 2026.
